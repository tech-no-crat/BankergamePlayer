Bankergame Player

A player for the Kamibu Jobfair 11 competition.
Problem description (greek): http://www.kamibu.com/jobfair/

This player was coded in ruby in a few hours. It includes a custom HTTP server.
Right now, aside from the protocol defined in problem description, this player
also supports allies. When playing as a banker against an ally, the banker takes
100% of totalamount, when playing as a client the player should accept giving
100% of totalamount to the banker.

To start an alliance, other players can call <hostname>/jobfair/start?id=<yourid>
once they receive their id.
